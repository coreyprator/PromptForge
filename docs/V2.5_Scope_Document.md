# PromptForge V2.5 Scope Document
**Integrated AI Bridge Architecture**

## Executive Summary

V2.5 represents a fundamental architectural evolution from a scenario-based development tool to an integrated AI-powered development environment. The primary objective is friction reduction through unified interface design that bridges AI communication, user interaction, and VS Code integration.

## Vision Statement

**"Build a bridge between AI, the User, and the Target Project's VS Code environment"**

Eliminate context switching between browser-based AI chat, PromptForge scenario execution, and VS Code development by creating a unified interface that integrates all three workflows.

## Core Problems Being Solved

### Current Friction Points
